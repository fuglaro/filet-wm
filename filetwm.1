.SH DESCRIPTION
filetwm is a minimalist window manager for X. It manages windows in tiled and
floating layers, across virtual workspaces, with support for fullscreen and
pinned windows.
.P
In the tiled layer, windows are managed in two columns. The left column is the
primary area and contains one window by default, while the right column is the
stacking area and contains all other windows. The number of primary area
windows can be adjusted to an arbitrary number, along with the primary column
size, by resizing any window in the tile layer.
.P
In the floating layer, windows can be resized and moved freely. All windows
start out floating and can be switched between the tiled layer on demand.
.P
Window focus follows the mouse and clicks will raise a window. If any
floating window is raised, all floating windows will sit above tiled windows.
Fullscreen windows that are not raised will sit behind the tiled layer.
.P
There is a small status bar which contains a display of the virtual workspaces,
with the selected workspace highlighted, and a customisable status message.
.P
Windows have thin borders and indicate the focus state with a highlight color.

.SH USAGE
The primary control interface is intended to be via the keyboard shortcuts
detailed above, along with mouse control for window focus, click-to-raise,
and all sizing movements, but additional mouse controls are supported:
